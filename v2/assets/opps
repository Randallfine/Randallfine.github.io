I am a husband, father, college student, and self-taught web developer. 
I am currently attending Southern New Hampshire University perusing my BS in IT with a concentration in Software Development 
and I am self teaching Web Development.
I am always learning, always growing, and always pushing forward. I am taking on as many projects as I can to sharpen and develop my skills.
